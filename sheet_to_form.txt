Code:

function updateForm(){
  // call your form and connect to the drop-down item
  var form = FormApp.openById("YOUR FORM ID");
  
  var itemList = form.getItemById("YOUR ITEM ID").asListItem();


// identify the sheet where the data resides needed to populate the drop-down
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  var items = ss.getSheetByName("SHEET NAME");

  // grab the values in the first column of the sheet (set the first parameter to 2 to skip header row)
  var itemValues = items.getRange(1, 1, names.getMaxRows() - 1).getValues();

  var itemNames = [];

  // convert the array ignoring empty cells
  for(var i = 0; i < itemValues.length; i++)   
    if(itemValues[i][0] != "")
      itemNames[i] = itemValues[i][0];

  // populate the drop-down with the array data
  itemList.setChoiceValues(itemNames);
 }


Comments:
1. Replace the .openById("Your FORM ID") in line 3 of code with your customised form id. You can find the form ID from your google form URL. For e.g. the url would look like this "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11YhQ3iheuyMd2rhCRj9RWlLBjSc9g6QL4Ot4khio10Y/edit". Copy-paste the part after d/ and before /edit.
2. In line 4, replace .getItemById("Your dropdown id") with your customised dropdown id. You can find the dropdown id in your google form by right clicking your desired question and selecting inspect element. Search for "data-item id" using Cltr+F to find the dropdown id for that particular question.
3. In line 10, replace getSheetByName("Your sheet name") with your sheet name you want to populate the data from. Note that give the sheet name (displayed by a tab at the left side on google sheets) and not the document name.
4. In line 13, names.getRange(2, 2, names.getMaxRows() - 1).getValues(), here the first '2' represents the row number, 2 means we are skipping the header row. The second '2' represents the column number. If you want to populate the data from column A, change it to 1 and so on.

Steps:
1. Create a Google Sheet and populate the data in the order you want your dropdowns to look. Sort it or trim it, if needed. Note that when you populate the data from google sheets to a dropdown, it considers every character as a string. Thus, it would add extra whitespaces to your form if they are present it in your sheet. 
2. Create a Google form and take note of the form id. After creating the questions, note down the "dropdown id" using inspect element as explained in Comment 2.
3. Now that you have your form id along with the drop-down id. Open the script editor by clicking on tools->script editor. You will be directed to a new tab for writing the google script code. Paste the code above and run the "debug" option first and check for any errors.
4. Run the script if debug function gives no error. In case of any errors, make sure the number of rows in the sheet <1000 and also, double check the parameters you've passed.
